# Hardware Models

Trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled devices (QCCDs) store ions in segmented
linear traps. Electrode voltages confine and move the ions; junctions connect
trap segments; and dedicated processing zones provide the control needed for
quantum gates.

Controlling this hardware spans several layers, from routing ions across a
device to executing local transport and control operations. IonShuttler uses
multiple abstraction levels to address these tasks at the scale and level of
detail they require. Each model retains the hardware properties relevant to its
compilation task and abstracts properties that belong to other layers or would
only complicate that task.

IonShuttler currently provides two hardware models at different scales. The Grid
model treats complete segments and their junctions as a routing graph. The
Linear model resolves individual sites and local transport within a trap
segment. A concrete device architecture supplies the layout, processing zones,
operations, and timing values for the chosen model.

## Grid model: a network of segments

The Grid model treats connected trap segments as the main storage and transport
locations. Each junction owns the segment endpoints that meet there. An ion can
move between any two distinct endpoints of one junction. Each segment contains
an ordered tuple of processing zones, which records their relative position from
the segment's canonical start to its end. The model tracks an ordered ion chain
in each segment without resolving the chain or processing zones into individual
sites. Performing gates requires the participating ion(s) to be (co-)located on
a segment carrying a processing zone.

This coarser level retains the topology that governs routing while reducing the
state needed to describe a large device. It is a good fit when network-scale
movement matters more than motion within one segment. A grid is one possible
architecture at this level; the abstraction itself is a graph of segments and
junctions.

`GridArchitecture` stores stable segment, endpoint, junction, and
processing-zone identities. The `square_grid`, `rectangular_grid`, and
`hexagonal_grid` helpers in `mqt.ionshuttler.grid.layouts` construct common
physical layouts. The `from_networkx` adapter converts an undirected physical
layout graph into the same canonical model. It does not retain drawing
coordinates, colors, or labels.

Each segment exposes a `start` endpoint and an `end` endpoint. A
`SegmentEndpoint` stores the segment identity and the literal orientation
`"start"` or `"end"`; the model does not define a separate endpoint enum.

This split also supports a future visual architecture editor. An editor can
store coordinates and presentation data in a separate geometry document keyed by
the stable hardware identities. Moving an item on screen will then not change
routes, schedules, or saved compiler state.

The {doc}`Grid compiler guide <grid_compilers>` introduces the corresponding
compilation methods.

## Linear model: sites within a segment

  <figcaption><b>Site-level model.</b> Ions occupy discrete sites and move into
  processing zones for gates.</figcaption>
</figure>

The Linear model resolves a trap segment as an ordered sequence of sites. Each
site holds at most one ion, so empty sites provide room to rearrange an ion
chain. A shuttle moves an ion to an adjacent empty site, while a physical swap
exchanges adjacent ions.

A processing zone contains one or more contiguous sites. A physical one-qubit
gate requires its ion in a processing zone. A physical multi-qubit gate requires
all participating ions in the same zone. Operations reserve their ions and
hardware resources for an architecture-defined number of timesteps.

This detailed level exposes motion and concurrency within a segment. It is a
good fit when local ion order and transport affect the result. The
{doc}`Linear compiler guide <linear_compiler>` shows how to define a concrete
architecture with the site-level model. The site-level model omits crystal
splitting and merging. Their overhead is included in the surrounding transport
operations.

## Shared scheduling assumptions

Both models use the same broad QCCD picture: ions move through memory and
transport regions to processing zones, physical operations take time, and
operations may overlap only when they do not compete for modeled resources. In
both models, time is discretized into timesteps and all operations take an
integer number of timesteps to complete. Each architecture supplies the concrete
layout and timing values.
